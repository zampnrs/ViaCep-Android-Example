# ViaCep-Android-Example

This app is a ContactBook to demonstrate the usage of:
- Hilt
- Retrofit2
- Room
- Navigation

In this app we consume the [ViaCep](https://viacep.com.br/) API to get a Brazilian address through the CEP (ZIP code).

UI and UX could improve a lot :sweat_smile:, but I'm not a designer.
